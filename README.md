# MEAN stack generator
Development of DSL for web applications based on the MEAN stack.

## Requirements
- Python 3+
- [Arpeggio](https://github.com/igordejanovic/Arpeggio)
- [textX](https://github.com/igordejanovic/textX)
- [jinja2](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/jinja2)

## Run
```
cd /path/to/project
python3 dispatcher.py
```
Generated code structure is in ```/path/to/project/gen/```.
## Execution steps
1. program loads DSL definition from ```lang/mean.tx``` and generates its meta model alongside its visual representation in  ```VISUALIZATION_DIR```.
2. program generate program model from test case based on meta model from previous step (test program is ```examples/clue-example.mean```).
3. dispatcher calls all the generators to fill templates.

### Upcoming
Every template should have corresponding generator module, dispatcher imports these modules from ```GENERATORS_DIR``` and runs theirs ```generate()``` function.

### Appendix
To convert ```.dot``` files generated by [textX](https://github.com/igordejanovic/textX) exports one could use [Graphviz] (http://www.graphviz.org/).
